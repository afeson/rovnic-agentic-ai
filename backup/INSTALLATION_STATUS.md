## 📌 IMPORTANT NOTES

### About requirements.txt

The main `requirements.txt` includes:
- pydantic==2.4.2 (requires Rust for pydantic-core compilation)
- langchain and langgraph (additional ML packages)

**Status:** Not needed for core functionality. System runs perfectly with `requirements-minimal.txt`.

### Solution

We're using `requirements-minimal.txt` which has:
- All 20+ pre-built wheel packages
- Python 3.13 compatibility
- No compilation requirements
- Full API functionality

### When to Use Main requirements.txt

If you later want to add:
- LangChain integration
- LangGraph workflows
- Advanced pydantic features

You would need:
1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
2. Then run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
